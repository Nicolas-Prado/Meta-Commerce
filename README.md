# Meta-Commerce
An E-commerce where you can create web-markets, products and wait for customers! Made in pure HTML, CSS, JS and PHP

->Little talk about how to setup the project to run:
To get this working you will need an PHP server to run the scripts of the project. I recommend Xampp(Apache) for that, in the internet you can easily find a tutorial to download it an get started!
Well, after that just turn on the server, put the archives in the right place(usually in the htdocs for Xampp) and see the website running!

->Obs:
The website has some bugs and parts that were not implemented. That's because the time to fix/implement these small parts would be huge, so I chose to leave it like that, after all it was just a project to study and improve my abilities.
